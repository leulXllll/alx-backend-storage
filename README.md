# 0x02. Redis Basic

## Project Description

This project is an introduction to using Redis for basic data storage. It involves creating a `Cache` class in Python that connects to a Redis server. The class includes a `store` method to save data with a randomly generated key and retrieve it.

## Tasks

* **0. Writing strings to Redis:** Implement the `Cache` class with a `store` method that generates a random key using `uuid`, stores data in Redis, and returns the key.

## Requirements

* All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.7.
* All Python files use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
* All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation and type annotations.
